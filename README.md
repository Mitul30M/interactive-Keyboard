<p>Check out my new work, an Interactive Keyboard right inside a Webpage ?!?! <b>How sick is that !</b></p>

I love when Web Designers make use of cool 3D scenes or models in websites to make it standout [ even if it might be a headache for us Devs ! :( ]<br>

<p>So I too started working with my 3D modelling skills and now I am even ready to implement these scenes and models into my own web based projects; 
<b>This one being the first of many</b>.
</p>

<h3>Here's the orignal 3D model of the keyboard which I made on <a href="https://spline.design/">Spline</a></h3>
